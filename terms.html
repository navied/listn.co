These Terms of Service and any other legal notices published by Listn on the Service, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Listn concerning the Service. If any provision of these Terms of Service is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms of Service, which shall remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any term of this these Terms of Service shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Listn's failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

Your use of the Service following any amendment of these Terms of Service will signify your assent to and acceptance of its revised terms.
